# Financial KPI Forecasting Dashboard

A real-world time series forecasting project to predict key performance indicators (KPIs) for a retail e-commerce business. This interactive dashboard was built using **Prophet**, **Pandas**, and **Streamlit**, designed to assist business stakeholders in making data-driven decisions by forecasting sales, quantity, and order volumes.

---

## Project Overview

In today's competitive business landscape, **accurate forecasting of financial metrics** is critical for demand planning, inventory control, and revenue optimization. This project builds a forecasting system using real transactional data from an online retailer and presents it through a user-friendly dashboard.

---

## Key Objectives

- Clean and transform raw retail sales data into meaningful KPIs
- Use **Prophet time series models** to forecast:
  - Total Revenue
  - Total Quantity Sold
  - Total Orders
- Present historical trends and future projections in an interactive dashboard using **Streamlit**
- Empower users to interpret and compare forecast vs actual KPI performance

## Forecasting Approach

We use **Facebook Prophet**, a robust and easy-to-use time series forecasting library, ideal for business data. It automatically handles:

- Trends
- Seasonality
- Holiday effects
- Missing values and outliers

> Prophet is especially powerful for data with strong seasonal patterns — like sales.

##  KPIs Forecasted

| KPI             | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Total Revenue** | Total sales revenue per month |
| **Total Quantity** | Number of units sold |
| **Total Orders**   | Number of unique invoices per month |

All KPIs are derived from real e-commerce transactions.

## ✅ Results Summary

| KPI | Model Used | MSE (last 6 months) | Notes |
|-----|------------|---------------------|-------|
| Total Revenue | Prophet | Lower than ARIMA | Prophet performed better |
| Total Quantity | Prophet | Accurate and stable | |
| Total Orders | Prophet | Stable forecast | |

ARIMA was tested but Prophet was selected for its superior accuracy, flexibility, and usability.
